<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>•   Unmanned smart self-navigating vehicle equipped with 3 IR sensors to map the traveling path and safely navigate through obstacles, detect optimal path recognition using reward algorithm to navigate its path.</p>

<p>•   Built Analog RF transmitter that oscillates with a frequency within the FM band.</p>

<p>•   Built Function Generator with multiple frequencies and multiple signal shapes that uses PIC microcontroller.</p>

<p>•   Watt Meter device (measure AC current, voltage, frequency, and total power) using Arduino microcontroller and display the result via Bluetooth to a cellphone android application (senior design team leader).</p>

<p>•   Planned and developed the layout of Powering and Switching System and designing its controller (via Bluetooth) and create an Android application to monitor and control switching.</p>

<p>•   Built a Coder and Decoder Software Telecommunication Messaging System.</p>
